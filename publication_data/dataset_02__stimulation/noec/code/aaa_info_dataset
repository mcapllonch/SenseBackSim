This includes MRG and Gaines sensory model.
The tissue properties have been modified according to the reviewers.
This is for the study of the effects of EC on stimulation at the first round of revisions.

UPDATE: 2ND ROUND OF REVISIONS:
This version of the code does NOT adjust rho_endo_longt of the fascicles as I did originally to make rho_endo_longt_eq match the nominal value 175 Ohm*cm. Instead, rho_endo is a isotropic resistivity with value 1211 Ohm*cm.
The only adjustment is to xraxial, by lumping  endoneurium and epineurium for those fibers overlapping with the epineurium. But this is something I did after the first round of revisions.
